business decisions. However, the market situation is becoming difficult, especially for people whose goal is to

and show you what skills will help you get your first job more easily!

It's time to open Jupiter Notebook! After installing Mercury(download link), we are really only a few lines of code away from creating a website.
In the first cell we will import mercury as mr

2.1)
In the second cell we will configure the Mercury App properties: title and description: 
Try to describe your project originally, it will help later to locate your work.

2.2)
Mercury after starting the second cell will pop you a notification , "Mercury Application This output won't appear in the web app."
Your notebook can officially be a page now.
But before we launch, let's add some widgets.

Let's start with MultipleSelect for the advanced levels.  

lvl = mr.MultiSelect(value=['Junior'],choices=['Junior','Mid','Senior'], label="Choose youre level")

3.1)
The task of the next cell is to select from our DataFrame the levels of advancement we have chosen.

df_lvl = df[df.category.isin(lvl.value)]

3.2)
And just create a graph using matplotlib.

level = df_lvl['category'].value_counts().nlargest(10).sort_values(ascending=False)
level.plot(kind='bar')

3.3)
Let's add another MultiSelect to our code.

sk_set = mr.MultiSelect(choices=['sql', 'python','snowflake', 'r', 'powerbi','excel','c', 'c#', 'javascript', 'js',  'java', 'scala', 'sas'], 
label="Choose your skills", value=['sql', 'python', 'r', 'snowflake'])

sk_df = skills_df[skills_df.skill.isin(sk_set.value)]

And all done!

Mercury will read all your code and create a web app. Now open your the command line and navigate to the location of your notebook. Once you've set everything up just type mercury run in the terminal.

**The application should open the page by itself, but if it doesn't, you can copy the page from your ternimal.

When you click on it, your own page will open.
