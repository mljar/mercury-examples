Data analyst is becoming an increasingly desirable profession, on the side of the employeeas well as the company. No wonder companies need specialists to help them make important business decisions. However, the market situation is becoming difficult, especially for people whose goal is to getting their first job. In this tutorial, we will show you two useful things for you, namely: How to create a website using Mercury. And at the same time we will analyze the job market to show you what skills will help you get your first job more easily! 

# How to create a website?
It's time to open Jupiter Notebook! After installing Mercury. 
```
pip install mercury
or
conda install -c conda-forge mercury
```
We are only a few lines of code away from creating a website.
In the first cell we will **import mercury** and other important library for your project.

```
import mercury as mr
```
## Show or hide code switch
The task of this cell is to determine the **checkbox**, so that we can decide with one click whether we want to show our code on the page.
```
show_code_switch = mr.Checkbox(label="Show code", value=False)
```

## Mercury App
To create a fully functioning site, we need to specify a feature called Mercury App. 
Try to describe your project originally, it will help you later to locate your work.

```
app = mr.App(title="Analysis for analysts",description="Data analysis relating to the skills a Data Analyst needs.", show_code=show_code_switch.value)
```

![enter image description here][2]

Mercury after runing this cell will pop you a notification , "Mercury Application This output won't appear in the web app."
Your notebook can officially be a page now. But before we launch it, let's add some widgets. 

## MultipleSelect for experience

In this scenario, we want to add MultiSelect for the job expertise as well as for your skills. Let's define our first multiselect as well as specify our options to choose from.
```
lvl = mr.MultiSelect(value=['Junior','Mid','Senior'],choices=['Junior','Mid','Senior'], label="Choose youre level")
```
The task of the next cell is to select from our DataFrame the levels of advancement we have chosen.
```
df_lvl = df[df.category.isin(lvl.value)]
```
![enter image description here][4]

And just create a graph using **matplotlib**. 
```
level = df_lvl['category']
level.plot(kind='bar')
```
![enter image description here][5]

From now on, our chart will show only what we have marked.

## MultipleSelect for skills

Let's add another multiselect to our code. What's good about this module is that you can add as many options as you want.
```
sk_set = mr.MultiSelect(choices=['sql', 'python','snowflake'...], 
                        label="Choose your skills", value=['sql', 'python'])
```
```
sk_df = skills_df[skills_df.skill.isin(sk_set.value)]
```
```
ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(sk_df['skill'], sk_df['avg_salary'], color='red', alpha=0.8)
```

And all done!

## Mercury run
Mercury will read all your code and create a web app. Now open your the command line and navigate to the location of your notebook. Once you've set everything up just type **mercury run** in the terminal.

![enter image description here][7]

The application should open the page by itself, but if it doesn't, you can copy the html: from your ternimal.

![enter image description here][8]

If everything has been done correctly you should now see this screen and your file.
When you click on it, your own page will open.

# Market analysis
As you can see, Mercury gives time-savers and changes ordinary notebooks to a more user-friendly as well as adding interact with data. Let's move on to analyzing the market situation.

## Who is looking for the largest number of analysts?
The freelance company Upwork with more than 2,000 job offerts is dramatically breaking through.

remotely there are more than 5,000 listings with this option.
